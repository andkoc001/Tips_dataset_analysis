    "This Notebook presents my analysis and interpretation of the _**tips dataset**_. This is done through the following:\n",
    "1. descriptive statistics of the raw data,\n",
    "2. graphical representation of the data - plots,\n",
    "3. inference of the implicit information by application of selected tools, methods and algorithms used in data analytics.\n"

    "### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common custom to offer some small extra money - a tip - to the staff of a restaurant on top of the bill after a satisfactory service received. Although the tips are voluntary, and the amount of the tips is not (usually) stated, by convention it is often advised to leave as a certain percent (e.g. 10%) of the total bill for the meal and service. \n",
    "\n",
    "The _tips dataset_ (being analysed in this Notebook) is a representation of tips given in a restaurant. The dataset in question is a record (allegedly real and true) of tips given along with total bills of a restaurant customers collated by a waiter working in the restaurant for several weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is organised in a form of an array, where the dataset attributes (aka features) are organised in columns, and the observations (aka instances) - in rows. The dataset consists of several data categories describing tips received in connection to circumstances, such as day of the week, gender of the tipper, etc. The data set includes 244 data observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _tips dataset_ is integrated with the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - an external Python package for data visualisation. This dataset from this source will be used in the subsequent analysis. The dataset, however, can be also obtained from other sources, for example as a .csv file from [here](http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html)."

    "\n",
    "Below we will try to find evidences either supporting or the opposite this hypothesis. I will also delve deeper into the question and seek whether I could distinguish such a relationship considering other parameters, such as among smokers and non-smokers. "

    "* Currency is irrelevant.\n",
