## 1. Introduction

This is my assignment project to Fundamentals of Data Analysis module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2019.

This GitHub repository documents my research, project progress (git version control) and findings of the _tips data set_ analysis.

The detailed project instructions: <https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf>

The primary objectives are as follows:
- Data description (descriptive and visualisation),
- Regression (relationship between total bill and tips),
- Analyse (relationship between the variables).

This project is intended to further familiarisation with data analytics. The project will allow to get practical understanding of handling data in Python environment. It is also intended to get familiar with the analytical tools. The tools include Python language with additional libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, etc. as well as Jupyter Notbook.

It is also intended to gain knowledge and understanding through practical exercises about data analysis algorithms and methods. These in particular, would include linear regression, grouping, correlations, classification and pattern recognition.

As an outcome of the project, it is hoped to become more proficient in data analytics concepts and methods, including data types and structures handling, data splicing, plots generation and interpretation.

As it is a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various functionalities not only for readability but also for my future reference.

### Assignment delivery

The project is delivered via this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_analysis/).

This README.md file contains only introduction to the project.

The analysis is is conducted within Jupyter Notebook [Tips_dataset_analysis](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_analysis.ipynb). The notebook include also my research description and findings are incorporated in the Jupyter Notebook.

Within the Notebook I test and describe the project progress and illustrate the applied concepts and methods together with code snippets as well as program outputs. This README.md file should be read in conjunction with the Notebook.

Furthermore, the repository include another Notebook, [Tips_dataset_sandbox](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_sandbox.ipynb). It is an unofficial part of my research - my sandbox dedicated for exploring and testing ideas to be later used in the actual analysis.

### The data set

The _tips dataset_ being analysed is well known dataset describing tips received in a restaurant. More details can be found in the Notebook.

## 2. Tools used for the data analysis

### Python language, libraries and modules

Python programming language is acclaimed for its capacity of handling large amount of data in scientific community of different specialisation. Its natural functionality has been extended by development of external libraries dedicated for specific purposes. Below are listed several I used for accomplishment of this project.

1. Numpy
   >NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. - Wikipedia
2. Pandas
   >Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. - Wikipedia
3. Matplotlib
   >Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. - Wikipedia
4. Seaborn
   >Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. - seaborn.pydata.org


## 3. Findings and conclusion

Data analysis is a powerful technique in relation to objects classification and machine learning. The tools used in the project - Python language and its libraries - offer a lot of functionality, of which just few were utilised in this project.

(Findings to be added...)
