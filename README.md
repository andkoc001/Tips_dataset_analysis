## Introduction

This is my assignment project to Fundamentals of Data Analysis module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2019.

This GitHub repository documents my research, project progress (git version control) and findings of the _tips dataset_ analysis. 

## Assignment objectives

The assignment concerns the _**tips dataset**_ analysis.

The _tips dataset_ being analysed is well known dataset describing tips given in a restaurant on top of the bill. More details can be found in the Notebook.

The primary objectives are as follows:
- Data description (descriptive and visualisation),
- Regression (relationship between total bill and tips),
- Analyse (relationship between the variables).

The detailed project instructions: <https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf>

This project is intended to further familiarisation with data analytics. The project will allow to get practical understanding of handling data in Python environment. It is also intended to get familiar with the analytical tools. The tools used in the project include Python language with additional libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, etc. as well as Jupyter Notbook.

It is also intended to gain knowledge and understanding through practical exercises about data analysis algorithms and methods. These in particular, would include linear regression, grouping, correlations, classification and pattern recognition.

As an outcome of the project, it is hoped to become more proficient in data analytics concepts and methods, including data types and structures handling, data splicing, plots generation and interpretation.

As it is a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various functionalities not only for readability but also for my future reference.

### Project delivery

The project is delivered via this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_analysis/blob/master/Tips_dataset_sandbox.ipynb).

This README.md file contains background information and introduction to the project. This README.md file should be read in conjunction with the Jupyter Notebook [Tips_dataset_analysis](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_analysis.ipynb), where the dataset analysis is conducted. 

In the notebook I have incorporated the research and described the project progress. It is illustrated the applied concepts and methods together with relevant code snippets. The notebook includes also the calculated outputs and plots with accompanied description. Finally, inside the notebook I have included also references to sources being consulted for this assignment.

In the repository, there is another Notebook, [Tips_dataset_sandbox](https://github.com/andkoc001/Tips_dataset_sandbox.ipynb). It is an unofficial part of my research - it was used for testing ideas to be later used in the actual analysis. Please ignore it for the assessment.

### Viewing the Notebook

For viewing the notebook online, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks viewer, [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the link to the notebook to be inspected into provided field.

## Tools used for the data analysis

_Python_ programming language is acclaimed for its capacity of handling large amount of data in scientific community of different specialisation. Its natural functionality has been extended by development of external libraries dedicated for specific purposes. Below are listed several I used for accomplishment of this project.

1. Numpy
   >NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. - Wikipedia
2. Pandas
   >Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. - Wikipedia
3. Matplotlib
   >Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. - Wikipedia
4. Seaborn
   >Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. - seaborn.pydata.org

_Jupyter Notebook_ and _Jupyter Lab_ provide interactive, web-based environment for data science and scientific computing. It emerged from IPython project.
